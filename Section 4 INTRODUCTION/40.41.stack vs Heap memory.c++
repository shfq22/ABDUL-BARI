// memory is divided into bytes



//  A stack is not flexible, the memory size allotted cannot be changed whereas a heap is flexible, and the allotted memory can be altered.
// the stack memory is automatically created and automatically destroyed

// programs cannot direcly access heap memory
// for heap memory ==>   
// int *p;
// p = new int[5];    // in C++ 
// p = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int) * 5);



// what is static?
//the size of memory is static
