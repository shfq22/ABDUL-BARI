// A common pattern that leads to logarithmic time complexity is dividing the problem size by a constant factor (often 2) in each step

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int n;

    for(int i=n;i>1;i=i/2){

    }

return 0;
}

// Time Complexity: Since the value of i is halved each time

// Time Complexity:  O(log n)
