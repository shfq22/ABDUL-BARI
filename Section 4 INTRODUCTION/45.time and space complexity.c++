int main(){
    int a;       // input space
    int b;       // input space

    int c = a+b; // auxiliary memory
}

// Space complexity generally represents the summation of auxiliary space and the input space. Auxiliary space refers to the space that we use additionally to solve a problem. And input space refers to the space that we use to store the inputs.



// total 3 steps which is constant which means O(1)
// time complexity : O(1)
